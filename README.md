## Instructions
1. Input the activity name.
   1. Note: At startup, Timer will load your latest activity and you can skip Step 2.
2. Click on the "Crează" button. A csv file with that name will be created in the "Activities" folder.
   1. Note: If an activity with the same name already exists, it will be loaded.
3. If your activity was loaded, the state of the window is updated as well (in the state in which you left the activity).
4. Click on the 6 buttons to start a step of your work: "📥 Descărcare", "⏳ Încărcare program", "🚀 Editare", "⚡⏳ Blocat, reîncărcare", "⏸️ Pauză" and "💾 Export".
You can click them in any order and as many times you want. Click the "⏸️ Pauză" button when you don't work at that activity.
5. By clicking the buttons, the start date-time of the step is recorded in the csv file (seconds precision).
While the step is active, that button will look like it's pressed.
6. The current duration of the active step and the total duration of all steps are calculated and displayed in real time under each button.
The duration is not saved in the file. The Pause step is not considered work.
7. [Not yet developed] After you finish the activity, click the "Salvare total în fișier" button to save all the durations in the file.
